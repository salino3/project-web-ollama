# SECURITY & SCOPE RULES

- You are strictly FORBIDDEN from creating, modifying, or deleting any file or folder outside the current project root directory.
- Do not execute any terminal command that targets paths outside of: ${current_working_directory}
- If a task requires accessing external files, you must stop and ask for explicit confirmation, for reading, because other actions (creating, modifying, deleting) are not possible, explaining why it's necessary.
- Never use absolute paths (e.g., C:\Users\...); always use relative paths starting from the project root.

# Project Standards: React + Vite + TS + SCSS (Pods Architecture)

## Technical Stack

- React 18+ (Vite)
- TypeScript
- SCSS (Individual files per component)
- React Router Dom

## Directory Structure Rules

You must strictly follow this folder structure inside `/src`:

- `/common`: Shared UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- `/common-app`: App-specific shared logic/components.
- `/router`: Routing configuration and constant paths.
- `/layouts`: Wrapper components for different page views.
- `/hooks`: Custom global React hooks.
- `/store`: State management (Providers/Context).
- `/pods`: Business logic modules. Each pod represents a feature or a main view.

## Component Pattern (STRICT)

Every time you create a component inside a Pod, use this pattern:

1. Create a folder: `/src/pods/[pod-name]/`
2. Component file: `[pod-name].component.tsx`
3. Styles file: `[pod-name].styles.scss` (Must be imported inside the .tsx file)

Example for 'home-page':

- src/pods/home-page/home-page.component.tsx
- src/pods/home-page/home-page.styles.scss

## Coding Rules

- Use Functional Components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Use SCSS modules or standard SCSS with specific class names to avoid collisions.
- All code comments and documentation must be in English.
