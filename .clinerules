# SECURITY & SCOPE RULES

- You are strictly FORBIDDEN from creating, modifying, or deleting any file or folder outside the current project root directory.
- Do not execute any terminal command that targets paths outside of the project root.
- If a task requires accessing external files, you must stop and ask for explicit confirmation for READING ONLY and explaining why it's necessary. Other actions are impossible.
- Never use absolute paths; always use relative paths starting from the project root.

# PROJECT STRUCTURE (Fullstack)

The project is divided into two main folders: `/front` and `/back`.

## FRONTEND RULES (Inside /front)

- Stack: React + Vite + TS + SCSS + React Router Dom.
- Directory Structure inside `/front/src`:
  - `/common`, `/common-app`, `/router`, `/layouts`, `/hooks`, `/store`.
  - `/pods`: Business logic modules.
- Component Pattern:
  1. Folder: `/front/src/pods/[pod-name]/`
  2. File: `[pod-name].component.tsx`
  3. Styles: `[pod-name].styles.scss` (Imported in .tsx)

## BACKEND RULES (Inside /back)

- Stack: Node.js + TypeScript + Express.
- Architecture: Controller-Service-Repository pattern.
- All backend code must be inside the `/back` folder.

## GENERAL CODING RULES

- Use Functional Components with TypeScript interfaces.
- All code, file names, comments, and documentation must be in ENGLISH.
